      <p class="pacmenP">
        This project is a simple kind of game using a classic Pacman type character. The game has 2 buttons 
"Add PacMan" and "Start Game", the "Add PacMan" button can be pressed as many times as desired adding 
a PacMan character at varrying places on the screen.Pressing the "Start Game" button will send all the 
PacMen moving at various velocities and bouncing off the edges of the screen.
I was given source code for this project and built the factory function so the PacMen could be 
repeatedly called.

        This project is two eyes following the curser around the screen. I was given source code of one eye, 
and my assignment was to add the second eye that also would follow the curser. I chose to also change
the background color from blue to purple.

        This project shows the bus stops on the route from Traverse City, Michigan, to Detroit, Michigan.
Originally this project was an assignment from Dr. Sanchez, finishing the javascript to show the bus 
stops from MIT's campus to Harvard's campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. From there, I changed the
style of the map, from a traditional road map to a satalite scan and masked over all counrties but
America with a slightly transparent white cover. I also changed the route to traveling to Detroit from 
Traverse City using data from Greyhound's website. I chose to skip stops that were within the same
city as previous stops.
